# True Formchange Sora
Skyline plugin that modifies Kingdom Hearts 3 Sora's appearance to switch between Formchanges during certain animations.

## General Changes
* The following list details the Formchanges used and when they're switched into that particular one:
  * **Second**: Down Aerial, Hurricane Blast
  * **Element**: Up Taunt, Firaga, Thundaga, Blizzaga
  * **Strike**: Forward Smash, Up Smash, Down Smash
  * **Guardian**: shielding, Counterattack
  * **Blitz**: ground rolls, air dodge, Dash Attack
  * **Ultima**: Final Smash (will override all other Formchanges while Final Smash is ready)
  * **Light/Dark/Double**: Aerial Sweep
* All standard attacks not listed will utilize the last Formchange switched to (applies to Jab, Tilts, Throws, and Aerials).
* Idle animation will "reset" Formchanges and switch Sora's outfit back to his base outfit.
* Victory animations unchanged, will still use base outfit.
